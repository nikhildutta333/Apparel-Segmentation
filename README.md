# Apparel-Segmentation and Dominant Color Detection

## Project Introduction
The objective of the project is to detect the dominant colors of the apparel in the image. We can use OpenCV to achieve the task to some extent. The detection of the dominant color happens in two steps.
1) Segmenting the apparel.
2) Extracting the pixels and clustering them using K-means Clustering to obtain dominant color.

## Getting Started

1) Clone the project in your local machine.
2) The file will contain the inputs file, paste the input images into that file.
3) Run the python code and the Output file with the output is generated.
